# ullu - An application to learn German

I've been using Anki for learning German, but I find it lacking. I wanted more,
so I created Ullu. Ullu is supposed to be [Anki](https://ankiweb.net/), but with
additional features and constraints.

_But why not build an Anki plugin for this?_

Well, because I am new in Berlin and I am looking for a job. This project is a
nice excuse to showcase my skills in technologies I am seeking a job in
(Typescript/React/Node).

*Features* I want to add top of my list.

1. Automatically generated grammar tips for sentences added

2. Opportunity to explore more about a word, grammar concept or sentence. e.g
   when I see a word used in an example sentence, sometimes I am curious about
   how else this word can be used. The app should allow me to take a word on a
   ride and see more examples of its usage, and add them to my exercise deck
   on-demand

3. Different ways of solving the exercises

   Instead of just front/back or "fill in the blanks", I want different ways of
   solving exercises. For example jumbled words thingy from Duolingo

4. Gamified experience

   Gamification is a gimick, it adds no real value. But value isn't the end-all
   be-all to me. I'd like a little joy every now and then. A silly looking
   cartoon celebrating my "scores" with a silly dance might just do that ðŸ˜Š

Ullu has additional *constraints*. Unlike Anki, Ullu isn't a "remember anything"
app, it is a "learn German" app.

## TODOs

Next stage for this app is to get useful for *me* asap. For that, I have chosen
these two tasks for immediate execution:

1. [ ] Import Anki decks per-user
2. [ ] Replicate Anki study experience

These steps will provide the ground for expanding Ullu to build extra feature
on.
